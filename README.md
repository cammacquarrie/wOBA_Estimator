# wOBA_Estimator
Neural Network used to estimate tSIERA
based off coursera project 
https://github.com/MaxPoon/coursera-Advanced-Machine-Learning-specialization/blob/master/Introduction-To-Deep-Learning/week2/my1stNN.ipynb


Goal of the project was to use statitics that quickly normalize to estimate SIERA accurately over as short of a period as possible.

SIERA is currently the best available true ERA reflector so it was chosen as the target.

Inputs were:

-Pitch selection by % (FB%, SL%, CT%, CB%, CH%, SF%, KN%, XX%)

-Pitch velocities (FBv, SLv, CTv, CBv, CHv, SFv, KNv)

-Contact%

-O-Swing%

-Z-Swing%

-Zone%


NN was organized as follows:

Layer 1 (Input): 10x10

Layer 2 (Dense, relu): 10x10

Layer 3 (Dense, relu): 10x5

Layer 4 (Dense, relu, Output): 5x1


RMSE for Test between 0.030 - 0.035


DATA - All data was taken from Fangraphs.com:

Pitcher season values 2002-2018 with minimum 30IP

- 5477 data points (4500 training set, 977 test set. 82/18 split)

- Learning rate set at 0.0001


TODO:

- Try SwStr instead of Contact

- Try to split Contact into O-contact, Z-Contact

- Add option to export NN for permanance
